Hash tables
A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values for highly
efficient lookup. 
A simple common implementation would be:

	1. First compute the key's hash code, which will usually be an int
	or long. Note that two different keys could have the same hash code,
	as there may be an infinite number of keys and a finite number of ints.

	2. Then, map the hash code to an index in the array
